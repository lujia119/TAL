 TAL coding test
area of improvements as below
1. Database tables should be used to save the data instead of using file input/output
2. I would create couple more tables to make this application more like a real-life app
   Table Room (RoomID, Room Description)
   Table TimeSlotDefinition (TimeSlotID, Time Slot Description). For example (sl1, 9:00AM to 9:30AM | sl2, 9:30AM to 10AM ...)
   Table Booking (RoomID, Date, TimeSlotID, Status)
   So that it supports multiple room bookings on any day.
3. There is definitely room for improvement on UI. Maybe a grid to show the slots is more user friendly and also a message should be displayed once the booking is made sucessfully.
